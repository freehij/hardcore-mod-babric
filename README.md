# Hardcore Mod for babric (b1.7.3)
Hardcore mode backport from 1.0 to b1.7.3
# Installation
- Download and install [babric](https://babric.github.io/use/installer/)
- Download [latest](https://github.com/freehij/hardcore-mod/releases/latest) babric mod version and drop it in mods folder
# Texture pack support
Custom icons are only used for hardcore (non hardcore uses vanilla texture) and should be located at /assets/hardcore/textures/gui/icons.png so you should add 2 textures at those two locations:

`/gui/icons.png` - for non hardcore aka vanilla texture

`/assets/hardcore/textures/gui/icons.png` - hardcore only

Their layout is exactly same.
